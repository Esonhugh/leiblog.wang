I am currently an undergraduate major in [Electronic Engineering](https://green.njtech.edu.cn), [Nanjing Tech University](http://www.njtech.edu.cn), ranking the 1st out of 59 students in the department with GPA 3.93/4.00. Learn Web/Security/Machine-Learning just because of interests and responsibilities ( i am also a little good at electronics major XD).

I have cracked the encryption algorithm of the school’s IC card (only for learning and use, not for illegal use), bypassing the campus network authentication by building a VPN by myself, and being able to enter the school’s surveillance.
